# Some information about this 
cost is: J = cfg.alpha * time      # time  ∝ distance because v_max is fixed
  + cfg.beta  * fuel      # thrust fuel + mis‑alignment penalty
  + cfg.gamma * grav_pen  # only when the path strays inside a gravity shell


# Things to improve
Automatic run naming system
fixing how the planet system works
- Starting with where it actually starts at
- Haaving like a system of planets. All of which have some kinda of gravity
- Picking one as a start planet
- picking one as a target planet
- The rest will be just normal, kinda sever as obsicalls, but this should not need to be specified as all should have gravity impacting orbits

- color code paths to start like blue then become red slowly at end point to show like time being passed ( can be any color)

- probably ignore the runs, have a special folder to save the best runs that might be used in like report or poster
